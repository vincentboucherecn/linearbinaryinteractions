## Replication Codes
+ *Lin_code.do* and *afterLincode.do* -- Stata script to extract and format the original data. The code *Lin_code.do* was graciously provided by Lee, Li and Lin (2014).

+ *Simulations.R* -- R script that performs the simulation study (see Table 1 and Table 5 of the paper).

+ *LeeLiLin.R* -- R script that computes the NLS and 2SLS estimations (see Table 2 of the paper) using the same dataset as in Lee, Li and Lin (2014).
