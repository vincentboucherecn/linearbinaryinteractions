## Replication Codes

+ *Simulations.R* -- R script that performs the simulation study (see Table 1 and Table 5 of the paper).

+ *LeeLiLin.R* -- R script that computes the NLS and 2SLS estimations (see Table 2 of the paper) using the same dataset as in Lee, Li and Lin (2014).

+ *CT_homogenous.R* -- R script that computes the 2SLS estimations for the application in Ciliberto and Tamer (2009) using the homogenous specification (see Table 3 of the paper)

+ *CT_heterogenous.R* -- R script that computes the 2SLS estimations for the application in Ciliberto and Tamer (2009) using the heterogenous specification (see Table 4 of the paper)
